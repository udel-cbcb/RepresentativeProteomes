## A stable, scalable and unbiased proteome set for sequence analysis and functional annotation

Reference Proteomes (RPs) (algorithmically determined), are proteomes that are selected from Representative Proteome Groups (RPGs) containing similar proteomes calculated based on co-membership in UniRef50 clusters. Reference Proteome is the proteome that can best represent all the proteomes in its group in terms of the majority of the sequence space and information. RPs at 75%, 55%, 35% and 15% co-membership threshold are provided to allow users to decrease or increase the granularity of the sequence space based on their requirements
